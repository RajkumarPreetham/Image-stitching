# Image-stitching

This algorithm combines multiple images into a composite image, by extracting the SIFT features and descriptors. These extracted features from multiple images are matched using brute force technique where in pre-decided threshold is already set.

Histogram equalization is performed in the resultant image to improve the contrast.
